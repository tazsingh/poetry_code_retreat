Poetry Code Retreat
===================

A solution to the Poetry problem for the [Sept 20, 2012 Toronto Code Retreat](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Code-Retreat/events/77472852/).

The problem is J4/S2 of the [2003 Canadian Computing Competiton](http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2003/stage1/2003CCCStage1Contest.pdf).

Running the code
----------------

From the project's directory, execute:

    node poetry.js
    
This will read the `poetry.in` file and output a `poetry.out` file accordingly.
